            <h2>Why is therapy important?
                <br>
                Well…. Therapy is important in a multiple ways, working with a  Therapist, psychologist, counsellor in a therapeutic relationship and environment helps you develop in a multiple ways
                <br>
                It gives you an opportunity to explore yourself, your thoughts, your feelings and changes the way you look at people and things, it helps you understand you, the best you.
                <br>
                Did you know that therapy can change the way you interact with people, in a good way, are you aware that at times we are negatively impacting our relationships with our loved and trusted one? When we lose our control we have no idea how we are negatively affecting our loved ones in many different ways, that break them inside, and we have no idea how they feel/ felt. On the other side of things, maybe we’re so used to keeping our feelings bottled inside that we have a hard time being assertive with the people we love. A therapist can help balance the way we communicate with our loved ones to improve our relationships.
                <br>
                Do you know the old saying “money can buy happiness”? Well honestly speaking, that isn’t the truth, money can’t buy you happiness, having a little too money can get you unhappiness as well but money doesn’t have an inherent value that makes our lilies more fulfilling. Buying fancy things might give us a temporary thrill or a sense of satisfaction, however these feelings don’t last or tend to last to scratch at the surface of true happiness, no one has claimed, the meaning of life is a car the meaning of life is thought to have more breadth and importance than fulfilling fancy things in life.
                So how does therapy help you feel happier and free on a deeper level? Talking over your past, present and future with a therapist can lead to a greater self-understanding, while self- understanding doesn’t always imply self-acceptances ,it is the first step towards truly embracing who you are at the core.
                And a multiple more reasons.
